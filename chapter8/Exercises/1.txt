The number of elements in an array can be calculated using;
sizeof (a) / sizeof(a[0])

It can also be calculated using the expression:
sizeof (a) / sizeof(t)
where t is the type of a's elements

The second technique is considered inferior to the first because if we decide to changethe type of element that 'a' stores later down the line, (for instance changing an int to a long, or a float to double).
then we would need to refactor every call to sizeof(t) to the new element type so that
we could correctly calculate the number of elements in the array.
